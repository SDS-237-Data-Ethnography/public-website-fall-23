## What does the following statement mean to you?

> On April 10, 2023 at 9AM Northamptonâ€™s reported AQI was 54.


---

## Turn to a neighbor and discuss:

- What information do we need to be able to interpret the meaning of the number 54 in the following slide?

---

## What is 'evidence'?

- Etymologically dual meaning:
  - Transparent, obvious, clear, speaking for itself
  - Appearance or indication, requiring interpretation

# How do numbers acquire meaning? Through what means do we determine their significance?

---

# Jot down a number that hold meaning to you and what it represents. 

---

## Turn to a neighbor and discuss:

- How do you know if this is a big or small quantity?
- Do you have a yardstick to help you determine this?
- How might this number mean different things to different social groups?

---

## Interpretive Flexibility

- Anti-determinist frameworks
- Refers to the differing meanings that social groups assign to technologies
- Explain how technologies are "socially constructed"

---

## Mobilizing Data Narratives

- Mobilization refers to the processes by which people prepare something to be put to use or into action
- Stakeholders strategically engage in meaning-making activities around data
- Shapes societal interpretations of data

---

## Framing Statistics

- Comparison/Ranking
  - Is x more/less than y?
- Standards-Setting/Benchmarking
  - Does x meet z standard/benchmark?
- Appealing to Emotion/Lived Experience
  - How does x make me feel/relate to my life?

## Take-aways 

1. The meaning/significance of numbers is not self-evident.
2. Data becomes meaningful as stakeholders develop tools for narrating the significance of a number.
3. Ethnographers can study these meaning-making practices.
