## Free-write for the next 2 minutes: You've submitted your first assignment - both individual and group. What have you learned so far that's sticking with you the most? What questions do you have about course infrastructure? What challenges have you run into?

---

## I encourage you to come to office hours if...

- You'd like to discuss strategies for managing the reading/workload.
- You'd like clarifications on any of the assignment expectations/course infrastructure.
- You'd like to review certain concepts discussed in lecture or the readings.
- You'd like to chat about opportunities for exploring more about data ethnography. 
- You're stressed and need some positive affirmation.
