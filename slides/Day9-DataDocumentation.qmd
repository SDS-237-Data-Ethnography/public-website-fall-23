## Metadata Schemas

- A standardized labeling system for cataloging or describing data
- Enables search engines to index data by certain criteria
- Examples:
  - Sort by "date created"
  - Retrieve all results from a specific "author/creator"
  - Filter results to a specific "subject"
  - Exclude results from a specific "publisher"

## Example: Citation Manager

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Data Dictionaries

- Documents for holding descriptive metadata
- Define the variables in a dataset and the values that may fill in those variables
- Are not always as descriptive as we'd like them to be

## Example: NYC Metadata for All

## For Monday

- Questions to consider:
  - What does Biruk mean when they refer to "translation" in this chapter?
  - Where do we see looping effects in this chapter? What gets "lost in translation"?
