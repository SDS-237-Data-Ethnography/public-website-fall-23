## When do ethnographers interview...

- To gather historical narratives based on insider knowledge 
- To gather detail about how people narrate their activities/work
- To ascertain individual assumptions and commitments
- To deepen understanding of how people see themselves fitting into their social worlds and how they communicate that


---

## Things to keep in mind...

- Interviews are co-constructed by the interviewer and the interviewee

> What does that mean? Why does it matter?

- Interviews are not aiming to get at the "truth" of events but to capture how people narrate them

> What does that mean? Why does it matter?

## Qualitative Interviews

- Involve open-ended questions seeking in-depth explanations and articulations
- Are often *semi-structured*
  - Enables researchers to follow-up, asking the hows and the whys
  - Allows the interviewee the flexibility to communicate from their perspective


---

## Preparing for an interview

- Identify an individual that can provide unique perspective 
- Reach out to that individual requesting an interview (See recruitment email in GitHub as template)
- Coordinate a date, time, and location for the interview. If conducting through Zoom, create a shared meeting link. Note how location matters for the tone of the interview.
- Ask interviewee to sign informed consent form (see attachment in GitHub)
- Conduct background research on the individual being interviewed and the institutions they are a part of. 
- Create an interview guide - with framing questions and transitions.

# How might we structure the flow of an interview? What kinds of questions do we start with and end with?

---

## Interview Guides

- General flow:
  - Start with more general question and move to more specific questions
  - Start with more matter-of-fact questions and move to more intimate questions as you build trust 
  - Close with a few lighter questions that prepare for friendly conclusion
- Preparing the guide:
  - Write more interview questions than you will have time to get to.
  - Group questions according to similar topics and themes. 
  - Prepare transitions for moving between topics.

---

## Framing Questions

- Ask questions that encourage elaboration and description.
- Consider how to frame questions so that they make sense to the interviewee:
  - My research question: What values inform your data work?
  - My interview questions: 
    - What motivated you get involved in this work? 
    - Who were your primary inspirations in this area and why?
    - What theorists/books were you reading as you got involved in this work? Do you find that relevant to your work today?

---

## During the Interview

- Thank the individual for joining, introduce yourself, and remind them of the purpose of the interview
- Start the recording, and state your name, the date/time, the location, and the person being interviewed
- Confirm on the recording that the interviewee agrees to be interviewed
- Draw questions from the interview guide that maintain the overall flow of the interview. Regularly ask interviewees to elaborate by asking "how?" and "why?" questions. 
- Takes notes on things the recording can't pick up on (e.g. Body language, Tone, Things you are reminded of as they're speaking) 

---

## Engaging during the Interview

- Engage in active listening (direct eye contact, nodding)
- Don’t rush the interviewee to move onto a new question.
- If the conversation veers allow it momentarily and then politely redirect it with a statement like, "I'd like to return to what you were saying about… Can you describe…?"
- Preface difficult conversations, and offer breaks if appropriate. 
- Don’t try and finish an interviewee's sentences. 
- Avoid explicitly sharing personal opinions on what they've said.
- Contemplate ways to reframe questions that an interviewee evades, exaggerates, or provides limited information on.

## Questions to consider:

  - Why does Biruk refer to the fieldworkers as "knowledge workers"? What kind of ethnographic move is this?
  - Biruk continuously refers to "boundary work" in this chapter? Can you extrapolate what she means by this? What are the effects of enacting boundary work in fieldwork?
  - What is "local knowledge"? How do credibility contests around "local knowledge" play out in this chapter?
