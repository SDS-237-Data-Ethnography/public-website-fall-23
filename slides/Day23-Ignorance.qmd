# Agnotology: the study of ignorance or doubt as invoked by various cultural forces

---

## Feminist arguments on the study of ignorance

1. Ignorance is more than a gap in knowledge. 
2. "Ignorance, like knowledge, is situated."

## Taxonomy of Ignorance

- Engineered Ignorance
- Undone Science
- Organized Ignorance
- Loving Ignorance

---

# Engineered ignorance: Knowledge that gets deliberately hidden from the public

---

## Big Tobacco Hides Cancer Risks


- Early 1950s, considerable expansion of research on tobacco health risks (e.g. lung cancer)
- Tobacco industry seeks to produce knowledge that will undo effects of emerging research:
  - Enlisted public relations firm Hill & Knowlton
  - Determined that advertising won't work because self-interested by definition
  - Sought out credentialed medical skeptics to engineer controversy
  - Created Tobacco Industry Research Committee and funded research to sew doubt/uncertainty

## Undone science: Areas of research that go unfunded, left incomplete, or get ignored

## Medical Funding 

- Nature reports that much medical funding goes to the "big three" - HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis
- Funding diverted away from "neglected tropical diseases"
  - Impact billions of people and disproportionately impact most vulnerable populations
  - Examples: dengue, leprosy, trachoma
- Covid-19 further diverted funding from these programs

# Organized Ignorance: Knowledge that doesn’t get produced because of the way science is organized


> Frickel, Scott, and M. Bess Vincent. 2007. "Hurricane Katrina, Contamination, and the Unintended Organization of Ignorance." Technology in Society, Perspectives on Hurricane Katrina, 29 (2): 181–88. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2007.01.007.


---

## Environmental Testing following Hurricane Katrina

- Only test contaminants designated by law (<200 of 8200 in TSCA) on public properties
- Tend to test where there was flooding, not where there may be the most contaminants
  - Most serious flooding escaped "sliver along the river" - location of the city's industrial corridor
  - Untested areas include several brownfields and areas with history of manufacturing expansion

## Colony Collapse Disease

- US beekeepers have lost almost 1/3 of bees every year since 2006
- Scientific studies of insecticides on bees were designed to test the *individual lethal* effects of a chemical on a bee population
  - Part of a "control-oriented" scientific culture
- Failed to account for slow, cumulative effects over time and the interactions of chemicals and pathogens
