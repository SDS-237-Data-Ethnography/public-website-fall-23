# What were some takeaways from Tuesday's class?

---

## Think about a category or label that institutions assign to a group of people. Free-write for about 2 minutes on the following prompt: How does the existence of this category or label impact certain social groups?

---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- Why does this category or label exist?
- In what ways has this category or label been normalized in society?
- What happens when folks don't agree with the assignment? Can they contest it?

---

## Assemblages

- Contests the idea that data are hard, shiny objects that can be held, acquired, etc.
- When we talk about data, we are actually referring to many interrelated things:
  - Materialities, practices, subjectivities, places, governmentalities, etc.
  - See table in this week's reading
- "Data" emerges in the wake of these interrelated assemblages
