# What did we learn about epistemology on Tuesday? How is this relevant to big data?

## Feminist Epistemologies

- All knowledge is **embodied**
  - Contrast with disembodied knowledge - i.e. not tied to a specific body
- Bodies are situated in certain social positions and have a finite point of view (Haraway 1991)
  - Critique of the "unmarked body," the "God trick," or the "view from nowhere"
- Knowledge is tied to particular standpoints 
  - Our experiences, what weâ€™ve read, our education, our social positions, and what our bodies enable us to do, see, hear, taste, touch, and smell
  - Factors are innumerable and unique to every person

## Discourse

- How we communicate or converse about topics, people, and things
- Dominant discourse characterizes the discourses that emerge as predominant throughout society
  - Shapes our values, identities, behaviors, and interactions with each other
  - Also shapes, disseminates, and is prodded by our ideologies, or worldviews
- Cultural hegemony describes when our ideologies reflect those with power over us

# What social institutions shape predominant ways we talk about things?

---

# What are some examples of dominant discourse?

- Technocratic: Technology will fix social problems. 
  - Computers will save the world!
  - Other examples?
- Dystopian: Technology is frightening or debilitating.
  - Robots will take over all jobs.
  - Other examples?
- Determinist: Technology determines how society operates.
  - Mobile phones are making us anti-social.
