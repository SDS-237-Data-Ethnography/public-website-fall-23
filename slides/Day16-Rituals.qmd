## Jot down some ideas of what this means to you: 

> This chapter makes one basic point: the work of producing, preserving, and sharing data reshapes the organizational, technological, and cultural worlds around them. - Jackson and Ribes, 2013

# What did we learn on Tuesday about the why's and how's of participant observation?

# Rituals Activity

## Discussion

- What did our ethnographers notice about the data collection? What questions did our data collectors have about how to measure the height of a student?

- What were our shared goals and beliefs about what would make "good data"?

- How did the rituals we designed shape the data? How did we organize ourselves to create pathways for the data to be comparable? 


---

## Reading Review: What are rituals?

- Stylized repetitive activities engaged in different cultural contexts
- May involve words, gestures, movements, exchanges
- Can sometimes be taken-for-granted and other times front and center
- **Mark the shared beliefs of a social group and membership in a community**

---

# What are some examples of rituals in communities that you identify with?

---

## Turn to a neighbor and discuss:

- How might this ritual be taken for granted by different social groups?
- What are some of the shared beliefs that shape the rationale for engaging this ritual?

---


# What were the shared beliefs **about data** discussed in Tuesday's reading? What did data collectors care about?

## Take-aways

- Shared aims of making data comparable, clean, and well-cared for are held by data collectors
- Environmental forces constantly threaten these aims
- Data collectors organize their social worlds towards these aims (e.g. establishing rituals)
- This shapes the context of recorded data
