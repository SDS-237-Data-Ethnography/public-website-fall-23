# Announcements

- Groups have been assigned on CATME
- Today, we will spend some time discussing group project infrastructure and field notes.
- Class discussion leads filling up quickly!

---

# What were some takeaways from Thursday's class?

---

## Imagine that you are an ethnographer attending Astro Hack Week. Pull out a sheet of paper and jot your name in the center. Around your name, list aspects of your cultural identity that would be important to acknowledge as you studied this space.

---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- Why would it be important to consider these aspects of your cultural identity as you engaged in ethnographic fieldwork?

---

# What are Birukâ€™s research questions?

---

> How do raw units of information - numbers written onto a questionnaire by data collectors - acquire value as statistics that inform national AIDS policy and interventions? 

> How do on-the-ground dynamics and practices of survey research cultures mediate the production of numbers?

> Finally, how are quantitative health data and their social worlds co-produced and with what consequences for local economies, formulations of expertise, and lived experience?

---

# What does Biruk make known about her assumptions/beliefs/values as she begins to interpret data?

## Critiques and Criticisms of Ethnographic Research

- Ethnographic research (like many other forms of research) has been historically complicit in imperialism and colonialism
- Methods emerged as part of European colonial efforts to document folks "Native" to "other" lands - often to enable control and exploitation of those cultures
- Many binary oppositions indicate how power operated here:
  - Studier/studied
  - Researcher/researched
- Concerns over who gets to "write culture"

---

## Reflexive Turn

- Emerged in the 1970s as a result of feminist and post-colonial critiques
  - Feminist: Where do we stand? Can we ever observe from an objective or neutral place?
  - Post-colonial: What do we consider "Other," and how do we portray what is "Other"?
- Called on ethnographers to engage in self-reflection (standpoints, assumptions, etc.)
- Can we write another culture "objectively" when our own biases and epistemologies, and social capital are inevitably involved in the research?

---

## ...aka the Literary Turn


- Ethnography was often understood to be about writing (documenting observations and interpreting them)
- Began to pay attention to power in the language used to "write culture"
  - Binary oppositions
  - Genre and representations of "fact"
- Called for making ethnographic writing more polyphonous (or represent a plurality of voices)
- Sometimes invited "poetics" and "experimentalism"

> In other words, there are political reasons as to why the fieldnotes that you read felt different than other scientific genres!

---

## Reflexivity for Each of our Methods

- Participant Observation
  - Observing interaction and behaviors "in the field"
- Interviewing
  - Engaging in semi-structured conversations with informants
- Archival Research
  - Curating and interpreting historical documents and artifacts
- Discourse analysis
  - Interpreting the cultural meaning interwoven in texts and speech
  
> In your groups, be sure to introduce yourselves to each other (pronouns, majors, etc.)
