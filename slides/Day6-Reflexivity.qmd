## Imagine that you are an ethnographer attending Astro Hack Week. Pull out a sheet of paper and jot your name in the center. Around your name, list aspects of your cultural identity that would be important to acknowledge as you studied this space.

---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- Why would it be important to consider these aspects of your cultural identity as you engaged in ethnographic fieldwork?

# What were some takeaways from Tuesday's class?

## Common Rule

- In the US, research organizations receiving federal funding are subject to the Common Rule
  - Laws and regulations regarding how Institutional Review Boards are to operate
  - IRBs are organizational bodies that review the ethics of human subjects research in order to protect human welfare, rights, and privacy before a study gets carried out
- Usually composed of representatives from an institution with a diverse background

---

## Tuskegee Study

- Conducted from 1932 to 1972 by US Public Health Services and Center for Disease Control, in collaboration with Tuskegee University in Alabama
- Involved 400 African Americans with syphilis 
- Study of leaving the disease untreated even though it was treatable
  - Were told they would receive free medical care
  - Never informed of their diagnosis
  - Provided with placebos and ineffective methods

## Facebookâ€™s Emotional Contagion Study

- January 2012, Facebook data scientists manipulated what 700,000 users saw on feeds to examine emotional contagion
  - Some shown happy, positive content
  - Others shown sad, negative content
- Legal?
- Ethical?

## Ethics of ethnographic research

- Ethnography different than many other forms of human subjects research in that it takes place in natural settings vs in clinical settings
- Question of how to balance benefits of the research with the potential harms posed to the participants
- Potential harms:
  - Reputation
  - Disclosure of personal information
  - Disruption of relationships
  - Loss of claims

# What about informed consent in virtual spaces?

# Reading Discussion

## Critiques and Criticisms of Ethnographic Research

- Ethnographic research (like many other forms of research) has been historically complicit in imperialism and colonialism
- Methods emerged as part of European colonial efforts to document folks "Native" to "other" lands - often to enable control and exploitation of those cultures
- Many binary oppositions indicate how power operated here:
  - Studier/studied
  - Researcher/researched
- Concerns over who gets to "write culture"

---

## Reflexive Turn

- Emerged in the 1970s as a result of feminist and post-colonial critiques
  - Feminist: Where do we stand? Can we ever observe from an objective or neutral place?
  - Post-colonial: What do we consider "Other," and how do we portray what is "Other"?
- Called on ethnographers to engage in self-reflection (standpoints, assumptions, etc.)
- Can we write another culture "objectively" when our own biases and epistemologies, and social capital are inevitably involved in the research?

---

## ...aka the Literary Turn


- Ethnography was often understood to be about writing (documenting observations and interpreting them)
- Began to pay attention to power in the language used to "write culture"
  - Binary oppositions
  - Genre and representations of "fact"
- Called for making ethnographic writing more polyphonous (or represent a plurality of voices)
- Sometimes invited "poetics" and "experimentalism"

> In other words, there are political reasons as to why the fieldnotes that you read felt different than other scientific genres!

## Reflexivity for Each of our Methods

- Participant Observation
  - Observing interaction and behaviors "in the field"
- Interviewing
  - Engaging in semi-structured conversations with informants
- Archival Research
  - Curating and interpreting historical documents and artifacts
- Discourse analysis
  - Interpreting the cultural meaning interwoven in texts and speech
  
> In your groups, be sure to introduce yourselves to each other (pronouns, majors, etc.)
