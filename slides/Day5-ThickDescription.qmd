- Your first group project - the team contract - will be due the following week.
- DM Rose if you'd like to lead class discussion.

# What were three takeaways from class on Monday?

---

## Imagine you were an ethnographer attending Astro Hack Week. Write a quantitative research question for a study you might conduct. Now write a qualitative research question. 


---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- How would these research projects look different?
- What kind of data would you collect?
- How would you interpret the data differently?

---

## Discliplinary Conventions

- What is considered a relevant research question?
- What kind of arguments are made?
- What kind of data is collected/produced/presented?
- How is collaboration valued?
- When/how is data shared?


---

## Disciplinary Genres

- Is text written in active or passive voice? Personal pronouns?
- Are subheadings chosen based on academic conventions?
- What kind of evidence is presented to persuade the reader? Statistics? Anecdotes?
- In what ways are research methods explicated?
- How and with what sort of detail are objects of study described?
- What role do poetics and metaphor play in the text? Can you identify emotion?
- What reflexive moves (self-reflection) does the author make? How do they elaborate their standpoint in/through the text?

## What is ethnography?

- Study of human cultures
  - Culture often defined as "semiotic"
  - Ethnographers aim to interpret the underlying meanings of surface actions and expressions
  - Make the "familiar strange"
- Often characterized as interpretivist and qualitative
- Typically involves extended, immersive fieldwork
- Has historically been a solo discipline
- Qualitative data rarely shared

---

## Methods of Ethnography

- Participant Observation
  - Observing interaction and behaviors "in the field"
- Interviewing
  - Engaging in semi-structured conversations with informants
- Archival Research
  - Curating and interpreting historical documents and artifacts
- Discourse analysis
  - Interpreting the cultural meaning interwoven in texts and speech
  
---

## Tools of Ethnography

- Field Notebooks
  - Document thick descriptions of observations
- Recording Devices
  - Audio and video documentation of interviews
- Coding Software
  - Draw out consistent themes of notes and interviews

- Describe in the "thinnest" terms possible what is happening in this image.
- Thick description moves towards interpreting its cultural meaning.
- Example drawn from a famous 1973 chapter by Clifford Geertz: "Thick Description: Towards an Interpretive Theory of Culture."

## Fieldnotes Assignment

-   Submitted via your GitHub portfolio
-   Must be >300 words
-   Must include and define one *Knowledge and Understanding* concept
-   Must be about a *data* environment encountered in the past *two* weeks
-   Must not only describe, but also *interpret* a data environment

---

## Recommendations

-   Discern something very small - the smaller the better - for your first field note.
  - Examples include one headline, a poster, one line of code, etc.
-   Stick with prompts and concepts that we've already learned (e.g. discourse, epistemology).
-   Review the rubric on GitHub

## Tuesday's Reading

- What are Biruk's research questions?
- What does Biruk make known about her assumptions/beliefs/values as she begins to interpret data?
