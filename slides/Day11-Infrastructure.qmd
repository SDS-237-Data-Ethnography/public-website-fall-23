## Identify something that meets Star's definition of an infrastructure. Jot down some ideas about how/when this infrastructure has broken down.

---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- How often do you think about this infrastructure? Did you notice it pre-breakdown?
- Who has a say in the design of this infrastructure, and who is excluded?

---

# Why does Star consider infrastructure *relational*?

---

## Star's Definition of Infrastructure

- Embeddedness: Sunk into other socio-technical structures
- Transparency: Does not need to continuously be reassembled
- Reach or Scope: Connects more than one site
- Learned as part of membership: Use naturalized through communities of practice
- Embodiment of standards: Component parts can connect through standardized conventions
- Built on an installed base: Wrestles with the logics of its underlying infrastructures
- Visible upon breakdown: Often taken for granted until breaking

---

# Select a favorite dataset. Brainstorm a long list of infrastructures that support that dataset. 

---

# Select one infratucture? How relational? How does it meet the other criteria of infrastructure?
