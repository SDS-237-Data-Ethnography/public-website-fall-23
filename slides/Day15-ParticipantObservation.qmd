## Reminders

- Fieldnote 3 due Thursday
- MP 2 due April 11
- Now is the time to start thinking about an interview


---

## Think about a data collection practice that you are acquainted with. Identify one specific thing that people try to *always* do when collecting that data. 


---

## Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

- Why do people try to do this?
- What meaning does it have for the data?
- How does it shape the environments/social worlds for the people that engage in this "ritual"?

---

## What is participant observation?

- An ethnographic method that involves embedding oneself in a community's day-to-day activities
- Ethnographer observes how people behave and interact through participation
- Ethnographer takes written notes on what they observe which are later elaborated

---

# Reflection Question: Is an participant observer an "insider"?

---

# How does participant observation enrich interviewing and vice versa?

---

## When do ethnographers do participant observation?

- To figure out what kinds of interview questions to ask
- To place checks on what people say during interviews
- To gather details about the physical and social environments in which individuals engage
- To deepen the ethnographer's understanding of social contexts

---

## What gets recorded in participant observation?

- Details about:
  - The physical setting
  - The quantity and demographics of participants
  - Their physical appearance (such as attire)
  - Their traffic
  - The tools they use and/or exchange
  - Their physical movements
  - The way they communicate with one another
  - ...and more.

# What might be some disadvantages to this method?

---

## Ethical Guidelines

- When should you announce yourself?
- Do you need informed consent?
- When is it advisable to identify participants?
- How should I behave in the space?

---

## Tips for Taking Field Notes

- Record the date, time, and place of data collection
- Record as much detail as you can about what you *observe*
- Leave space in notes to expand later
- Use abbreviations and shorthand when possible
- Create maps and graphics to help you remember details


--

## Expanding Field Notes

- Schedule a time to do it shortly after observation
- Convert your notes into a descriptive narrative
- Layer interpretations of your observations
